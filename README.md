The folder contains two Jupyter notebooks `StarNet.ipynb` and `AstroCLIP.ipynb`, the paper in progress, and supporting sub-folders: 
- `DATA`: contains cleaned spectral data. 
- `FIGURES`: contains .png figures of all plots.
- `lightning_logs`, `logs`: contains logs of ML models. 
- `MODELS`: contains working, saved ML models. 
    - `OLD_MODELS`: contains old models. 
- `OLD NOTEBOOKS`: contains an archive of old Jupyter notebooks.
